    <h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I am not a Muslim, and none of my family members or close friends are Muslims.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>As Hermann Hesse wrote in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siddhartha</a>: "(Siddhartha) had been able to do three noble and undefeatable feats: fasting, waiting, thinking."</p>
<p>The idea of suppressing physical feeling always fascinates me since I was a kid. As I grew up, I always believed that feeling and reasoning add up to a certain amount and that the more feeling you feel, the less reasoning you'll have, and vice versa.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't even know if this is true, but I have been thinking like this for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>So Ramadan seems like a good time to practice my theory -- no food and no drink from sunrise to sunset for one month. According to my <a href="http://www.waterloomasjid.com/main/masjid_media/ramadan_timetable_2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">local Masjid's time table</a>, the first day's fasting starts at 4:57 am and ends at 8:16 pm, and as the day grows longer, the last day's fasting starts at 4:09 am and ends at 8:49 pm.</p>
<p>However, you might recognize that the reason above doesn't answer why I didn't observe Ramadan before. If I always wanted to give it a try, why did I wait until this year?</p>
<p>The answer is that Ramadan 2020 is special. With the pandemic going on, we all work and study at home. I was too afraid of fasting in front of people, as they would notice for sure. What should I say if someone asks me why do I fast?</p>
<p>"When you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show others they are fasting." (Matthew 6:16) (I should also add that I'm not a Christian and none of my family members are.)</p>
<p>That's why I finally took action at this year's Ramadan during the lockdown. All my fasting and thinking are solely for myself. I didn't do this for anyone else. It's just between me and my Gods.</p>
<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>
<p>Ramadan 2020 began on the evening of April 23 and ended on the evening of May 23.</p>
<h3 id="sleep">Sleep</h3>
<p>Before Ramadan, I thought the hardest part should be being hungry all the time. However, at least for me, the hardest part was sleeping.</p>
<p>As described above, I ate Suhoor before sunrise and broke my fast at Iftar after sunset.</p>
<p>This means I have to adjust my sleep schedule. During Ramadan, I went to bed at 10 pm and got up at 4 am. Later on when the sun set later and rose earlier, I slept from 10:30 pm to 3:30 pm, and took a nap every day before I started working. I slept for only 2 hours at the first night thanks to my terrible sleep schedule before Ramadan. I used to sleep from 4 am to 11 am :)</p>
<h3 id="eat">Eat</h3>
<p>Suhoor Ideas:</p>
<p>I need something that contains enough energy, fiber, protein, and water that can last to Iftar.</p>
<p>TL;DR: none of them was successful. Feel free to skip this part.</p>
<h4 id="baked-eggs">Baked eggs:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Pretty much followed <a href="https://www.eggs.ca/recipes/easy-baked-eggs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this recipe</a></p></li>
<li><p>I don't have a muffin cup, so I used a glass container instead.</p></li>
<li><p>It took way more than 10 minutes as suggested in the recipe since a whole container of eggs is hard to cook thoroughly.</p></li>
<li><p>Rating: 4/10</p></li>
<li><p>Comments: Won't try again. I made some for the first week and they tasted awful. I was so happy when I finished all that I made.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="mason-jar-breakfasts">Mason jar breakfasts:</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>I tried (layers from bottom to top) quick oat + avocado + yogurt + pumpkin seeds + banana.</p></li>
<li><p>As for the quick oat, I put them at the bottom and add a little water/milk to it. I did so because I want the water from the yogurt and the fruits above to soak it well.</p></li>
<li><p>I know it should be stored in the fridge until when you want to eat it, but for me, I just can't eat cold food when I wake up. So I made it every night before going to bed and eat it the next dawn without putting it in the fridge overnight.</p></li>
<li><p>Rating: 6/10</p></li>
<li><p>Comments: The rest were fine but the avocado made my tongue tingle! It happened every time when I prepared it the night before. Some strange reactions were probably going on. I stopped making this after 10 days or so.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After running out of Suhoor ideas, I went back to my regular breakfast. But I did eat more for breakfast since I wouldn't eat lunch. Turned out to be much better than "Suhoor ideas".</p>
<h3 id="drink">Drink</h3>
<p>I drank two cups of water during Suhoor, one cup of water (and two dates) before Iftar, and two cups of water before I went to bed.</p>
<p>My lower legs were swollen and my feet were painful. It deteriorated as Ramadan went on. I'm not sure whether it was related to my binge drinking.</p>
<h3 id="quran">Quran</h3>
<p>I finally re-read the Quran from cover to cover again after... 8 years.</p>
<p>And I really need some annotations.</p>
<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>I was very grateful that I didn't need to go to the office for work, and that the weather in Waterloo was colder than usual. In fact, we had a snow on May 11.</p>
<p>The two reasons were crucial for my fasting. Because of them, I didn't move much, and I didn't sweat during the day.</p>
<p>And two events:</p>
<p>I moved on May 1 because my lease ended in April. On that day, I carried down 7 suitcases and storage boxes from my old apartment on the third floor (no elevator), walked to my new apartment because the car I called wasn't able to fit me in after I put all my belongings in, and carried up everything to my new apartment on the second floor (no elevator). After that I took a bus to the grocery store and bought a bunch of food and carried them back. To my surprise, after all that I've done, I was not hungry or thirsty at all.</p>
<p>A couple of days later, I woke up exactly one minute after sunrise, so according to the "rule", I couldn't eat or drink until sunset. Miraculously, I was again not hungry or thirsty until Iftar.</p>
<p>I somehow think that both events happened according to Gods' will. I understand that things I thought impossible can actually be achieved with the help of my Gods.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>Ramadan was a good time for building habits. For example, I began to stick to my new sleep schedule. I adopted the habit of exercising and watching videos in German.</p>
<p>In this sense, Ramadan 2020 was successful, as it did suppress my physical feeling and desire, and gave me more time to do the things I wanted to do.</p>
<p>I may try it again next year, but it will depend on the situation.</p>
